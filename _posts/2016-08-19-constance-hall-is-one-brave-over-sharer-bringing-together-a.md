Constance Hall is one brave over-sharer bringing together a community of women that support each other instead of tearing each other down.

Her relationship is far from perfect and her no-holds-barred posts, equal parts raw and hilarious have found a community of fans that 

Her tribe of four young children are the basis of endless daily struggles that inevitably lead to insightful realisations.

No subject is off limits, perfection is considered an unreasonable expectation and absolutely no judging allowed.

Instead, Queens jump on a different set of bandwagons promoting self-love, loving your partners and kids in any way that feels right and helping others.

Queens understand that we all have tough days and being that angel that helps out just may be the thing that gets you through the week.

Queens come together to raise funds for fabulous causes, provide random acts of kindness for strangers, support each others artistic and business ventures and share their own stories. No Queen is left behind.
